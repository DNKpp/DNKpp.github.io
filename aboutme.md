Hey, I'm Dominic Koepke - a passionate c++ software-developer from Ulm, Germany.
I'm working part-time as a software-developer; the other half of the week I'm working on my personal game, which hasn't been announced yet.

When I find some time, I'm actively maintaining [mimic++](https://github.com/DNKpp/mimicpp) - my own c++-20 mocking framework.

I'm very much interested in software-design in general and also don't hesitate making contributions to open-source projects.
